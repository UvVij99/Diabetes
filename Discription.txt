
Diabetes
This is a project for diabetes prediction of person based on the dataset provided.
Dataset is taken from kaggle.com the for the dataset is
 (" https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/diabetes-data-set ")

In this project we predicted whether the person is diabetic or not and based on that we trained our model, train and testing of model is done throughout the project.
We did a Visualisation of our dataset and model.

Firstly it is required to install all the libraries used in this project.
To do that just install the packages as mentioned in readme file.

>In this project first we loaded the dataset from csv file by pandas library.

>Then we described our data. 

>Then with the help of matplotlib and seaborn libraries we visualised our data.

>Then we standardized our data with the help of sklearn packages commands such as “StandardScaler()”.

>Then we trained our model using svm from sklearn library.

>After training we evaluated our model to get the accuracy score.

>And last we made a predictive system to predict whether the person is diabetic or not..
